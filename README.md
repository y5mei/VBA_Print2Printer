# Welcome to VBA_Print2Printer
###  Explanation
---
This is a **Windows Word VBA Script** made in April 2017 for Eston Manufacturing, Guelph, ON. 

In order to save more trees and implement goal of "paper-less office", on a Sheffield CMM running Renishaw Modus software, PDF Creator was selected as the default printer to covert RTF results into PDF format after inspection finished. But people do want to get a hard copy sometimes. Manually define which printer to print is too time consuming in Office Word. This VBA Script will use a user defined printer to make the printout while keep the default printer unchanged.
